    "The algorithm is fully specified in appendix C of <a href=\"https://mmu.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1334132058\" target=\"_blank\">Stallings</a>. There you will find flowcharts and explanations of how the DES algorithm works. \n",

    "\n",
    "At the bottom of this notebook you will find Python definitions for lists defining the various transformation functions that form part of DES as described in appendix C. You are encouraged to make use of these, and suitable Python commands to answer the questions. "

    "#### Warning\n",
    "In the description of DES in Appendix C of Stallings, when referencing the position of a bit in a message block he uses index references beginning at 1. So the left-most bit in a message block is at index 1, the next bit is at index 2 and so on. However when referencing bit positions in binary strings in your Python commands you will need to remember that Python references positions in arrays, strings etc using indexing beginning at 0. So the leftmost bit in a binary string is at index 0, the second bit is at index 1, and so on. You will need to be careful to avoid any *off-by-one* errors. "
