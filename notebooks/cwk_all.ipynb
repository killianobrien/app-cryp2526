    "#### Warning on array/string indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"background-color:gold;\">In the description of DES in Appendix C of the Stallings textbook, when referencing the position of a bit in a message block he uses index references beginning at 1, which is appropriate when speaking in plain English. This convention is also used in the various variables defined below that define the various transformations from Appendix C. So the left-most bit in a message block is at index 1, the next bit is at index 2 and so on. However, when referencing bit positions in binary strings in your Python commands you will need to remember that Python references positions in arrays, strings etc using indexing beginning at 0. So the leftmost bit in a binary string is at index 0, the second bit is at index 1, and so on. You will need to be careful when switching between plain language descriptions and Python code to avoid any *off-by-one* errors.</p>"
