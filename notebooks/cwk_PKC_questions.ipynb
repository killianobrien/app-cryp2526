    "* **Q1** Let $p$ be the smallest prime satisfying $p \\geq n$ and let $q$ be the smallest prime satisfying $q \\geq (n+10^6)$. Let $m$ denote the product $m = p \\cdot q$. Determine the values `p,q,m` with the help of Sympy's `nextprime` function.\n",
    "* **Q2** Your public key is the pair $(101,m)$. Determine your corresponding private key pair $(d,m)$. Store the relevant value in the variable `d`.\n",
    "* **Q3** Use your public key to encrypt the message represented by your number $b$. Store the encrypted value in the variable `M`.\n",
    "* **Q4** Finally, decrypt the encrypted message $M$ with the use of your private key and confirm that the plaintext message $b$ is recovered. \n",

    "**Diffie-Hellman key exchange** Questions 5 &mdash; 7 concern the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. \n",

    "* **Q5** Let $p$ be defined as in Q1, i.e. the smallest prime satisfying $p \\geq n$. Determine the smallest positive integer $\\alpha$ such that $\\alpha$ is a primitive root modulo $p$. Store this in a variable `alpha`.\n",
    "* **Q6** Alice and Bob agree to a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the prime $p$ and primitive root $\\alpha$. Alice's private key is $X_A = a$ and Bob's private key is $X_B = b$. Determine the public keys $Y_A$ and $Y_B$ exchanged by Alice and Bob. Store these in variables `YA` and `YB`.\n",
    "* **Q7** Determine the shared secret key $K$ that Alice and Bob can compute. Store this in a variable `K`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Q8** Let $p$ be defined as in Q1, i.e. the smallest prime satisfying $p \\geq n$. Confirm that $p$ passes the Miller-Rabin test by carrying out the necessary computations to confirm the expected value(s) modulo $p$ of the exponential(s) with base $a$. "
