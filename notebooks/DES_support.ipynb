    "The DES questions are inspired by question 4.11 from Stallings. The question parts guide you through the application of a single round of the DES encryption algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is fully specified in appendix C of <a href=\"https://mmu.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1334132058\" target=\"_blank\">Stallings</a>. There you will find flowcharts, data tables and explanations of how the DES algorithm works. \n",
    "\n",
    "The questions will take you through the initial preparation of your message $m$ and key $k$, the calculation of the first sub-key $K_1$, and then the calculation of $L_1$ and $R_1$, the outputs of round 1 of DES. You are asked to maintain $m$, $k$ and the other intermediate outputs as *binary strings*, i.e. Python strings consisting made up of the characters `1` and `0`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you confirm the correctness of your work I have pre-computed the correct outputs of the final DES question for each student. If your final output matches with this then you can be confident that your answer is technically correct. If not, you must still have some unresolved errors in your implementation of DES. You can find these checking strings at <a href=\"./des.html\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a>.\n",

    "### Warning on array/string indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"background-color:gold;\">In the description of DES in Appendix C of the Stallings textbook, when referencing the position of a bit in a message block he uses index references beginning at 1, which is appropriate when speaking in plain English. This convention is also used in the various variables defined below that define the various transformations from Appendix C. So the left-most bit in a message block is at index 1, the next bit is at index 2 and so on. However, when referencing bit positions in binary strings in your Python commands you will need to remember that Python references positions in arrays, strings etc using indexing beginning at 0. So the leftmost bit in a binary string is at index 0, the second bit is at index 1, and so on. You will need to be careful when switching between plain language descriptions and Python code to avoid any *off-by-one* errors.</p>\n",
