    "* 11.2 First read the comment below:\n",
    "\n",
    "This question asks about a proposed hash function with a straighforward definition based on the use of the DES encryption algorithm as the compression function $f$, with a message block taking the palce of the key. The question directs you to finding a security vulnerability in the hash function where the same hash value can be produced by processing an altered message. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question refers to a *complimentarity property* of DES. So first some background. Given a bit sequence $b$, the compliment $b'$ of $b$ is the bit sequence obtained by changing all $0$s to $1$s and changing all $1$s to $0$s, the *bit-wise compliment* in other words. So for example, if $b=$ `1101001`, then $b'=$`0010110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\oplus$ denote the usual bit-wise $\\text{XOR}$ operation and let $a$ and $b$ denote two bit sequences of the same length. Think about and prove to yourself that \n",
    "$$(a \\oplus b)' = a' \\oplus b,$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$a' \\oplus b' = a \\oplus b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with these definitions and properties in mind, you can engage with the problem 11.2 in Stallings. In answering the question you can consider altering the hash function by altering the initial values that initialise the beginning hash $H_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards you might think about the previous problem 4.14, referred to in 11.2. That is, can you prove the *complimentarity property* of the DES encryption function $E$, i.e. that $((E(K,X))' = E(K',X')$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A question to think about: Would such regularity in the behaviour of DES encryption be seen as a security vulnerability for the use of DES as a message encryption algorithm, i.e. its original intended use?\n",
