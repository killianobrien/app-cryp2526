    "The Advanceed Encryption Standard (AES) makes use of the field $\\text{GF}(2^8)$, consisting of polynomials of degree less than or equal to 7, with binary coefficients and polynomial operations carried out modulo the irreducible polynomial \n",
    " $$m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x +1.$$\n",
    " \n",
    " The integers $n$ in the range $0 \\leq n \\leq 255 = 2^8 - 1$ can be represented by the elements of $\\text{GF}(2^8)$ by considering the the 8 binary digits of the binary representation of $m$ to be the coefficients of the polynomial. For example, the integer $n= 201$ has the representation `11001001` as a binary string. This string can be obtained from the output of the Pytho command `bin(201)`. So the polynomial corresponding to $m=201$ is given by \n",
    " $$m = 201 \\leftrightarrow x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + 1,$$\n",
    " i.e. the digits in the binary expansion of $201$, reading left to right, give the coefficients of $x^j$, for $j=7,6, \\dots 2, 1, 0$. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Question parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions require inputs derived from your student ID number. Let $n$ denote your 8-digit Man Met student ID number. Now let $a$ and $b$ denote the 4-digit integers formed by, respectively, the left-hand and right-hand halves of $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $n = 21395495$ then we would have $a=2139$ and $b=5495$. But when working on these questions make sure that you are using your correct values of $n$, $a$ and $b$."
