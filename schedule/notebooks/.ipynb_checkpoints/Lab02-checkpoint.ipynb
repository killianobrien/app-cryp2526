So to launch your Jupyter notebook server simply search for `Jupyter` on the `Start` menu and launch the app. This should present you with a file browser in a web browser. From here you can launch a `Python3` notebook. \n",

Markdown cells can be used to enter text description of your work, Just like you see here in this labsheet. Guidance can be found in the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html)."
